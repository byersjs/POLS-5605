Here you can find links to everything you’ll need this semester:\n\nThe course syllabus\nSubmit assignments at our course HuskyCT page (mortarboard icon in the upper right).\nI will post code, data, and lecture notes on the course GitHub repository (the octocat icon in the upper right).\n\n\nCourse Description\nScholars in political science and in disciplines across the social sciences are increasingly relying on quantitative, data-driven methods to answer important questions in their field. This course provides an introduction to the study of politics through quantitative reasoning and data analysis. Like a traditional research methods course, we will cover the fundamentals of empirical research in political science including causal inference, summary statistics, data visualization, and regression. However, unlike a traditional research methods course, this course places a particular emphasis on developing technical skills used to conduct real world data analysis. Therefore, a significant amount of the coursework will be dedicated to learning how to program in the statistical computing environment, R. The goal is for you to gain a valuable skillset in data analysis that you can use in your political science classes and, more importantly, in your future careers.\n\n\nCourse Objectives\nTogether, we will strive for your individual and collective success in achieving the learning outcomes of this course. At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:\n\nDefine and describe the varied nature of quantitative analysis in political science\nUnderstand each step of the data lifecycle, identify potential sources of statistical and human bias, and determine their implications on the scope of inference.\n“Think with data” by using statistical software to explore, analyze, visualize, and interpret nontrivial datasets with relevance and importance to the social sciences.\nIdentify and evaluate misuses, distortions, and misrepresentations of data and statistics.\nApply your statistical literacy to issues within political science.\nCommunicate clearly and persuasively with data\n\n\n\nCourse Materials\nTo maximize access to this class, we will use some textbooks, videos, and other resources, with a focus on the following:\n\nPrimary Text (DASS): Imai, Kosuke. 2018.
